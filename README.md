# Self Study Repository

A repository to hold exercises for books, courses, and articles I'm working through or have worked through to build foundational knowledge

## Archive

- Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (Chapters 1-6)

  - Solid read, very beginner friendly with pretty easy (but with confusing instructions) exercises
  - a bit boring but recommend for an introduction to networking concepts

- TypeScript

  - [You Might Not Need An Effect](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) - must read for any React programmer
  - [React as a runtime](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/) - good details on reconciliation and how React works as a runtime
